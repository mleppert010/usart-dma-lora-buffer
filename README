DMA/Ring Buffer based line buffering for RYLR998 module with loopback, intended for use non buffering serial terminals.

Will use DMA to move USART bytes into a ring buffer, which is then cleared at half intervals, or on IDLE line to a larger buffer for analysis.

The program will then manage looping back this data, as well as performing backspace, delete, and arrow key functionality.
